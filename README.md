To achieve the transformation of the datasets as outlined in the homework instructions, we can follow the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Load the data to a jupyter notebook.
   - Reframe the data into jsonl

2. **Data Reframing:**
   - Reframe each jsonl according to the guidelines provided in the homework instructions.

3. **Prompt Engineering:**
   - Design suitable prompts for each reframed task.

4. **Handling Ambiguity and Distractors:**
   - Generate distractors for tasks where only a single correct answer is provided.
   - Ensure that distractors are diverse, non-repetitive, and challenging.

6. **Quality Check:**
   - Perform a thorough quality check on the generated datasets and prompts.
   - Verify that the JSONL files are correctly formatted and contain all necessary information.
   - Ensure that prompts are effective and align with the desired task formulations.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document your tasks comprehensively, explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.
   - Compile a comprehensive report outlining the methodology used, challenges faced, and solutions implemented during the dataset transformation process.
